# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process implemented in this project. CI/CD helps us automate the build, test, and deployment phases, improving development speed and software reliability.

## Tools Used

- **Jenkins**
- **Docker** – Containerize the application for consistent environments.
- **Kubernetes / Helm** – Deploy to the desired environment.
- **SonarQube** (optional) – Static code analysis and quality gate.
- **Slack / Email Notifications** – For build and deployment status alerts.

## CI/CD Workflow

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)

Triggered on:
- Merges to `production.g1` (for production)
- Merges to `production.g2` (for staging)

Steps:
1. **Build Docker Image** – Tag with version or commit hash.
2. **Push to Docker Registry** – Upload image to DockerHub / ACR 
3. **Deploy to Environment** – Use Helm or Kubernetes manifests.
4. **Run Smoke Tests** – Verify basic functionality.
5. **Notify Team** – Slack/email notification of deployment status.

## Branch Strategy

- `master`: Production-ready code.
- `develop`: Integration branch for testing.
- `feature/*`: Feature-specific branches.
- `hotfix/*`: Critical fixes directly to production.

## Environment Variables

CI/CD pipelines use environment variables for security and configurability. These may include:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `KUBE_CONFIG`
- `ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., dev, staging, prod)

## Deployment Environments

| Environment | Branch        | URL                          |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Staging     | `production.g2`     | https://staging.example.com  |
| Production  | `production.g1`        | https://www.example.com      |

## Troubleshooting

- Check pipeline logs in the CI tool for failed jobs.
- Ensure secrets and environment variables are configured properly.
- Validate Helm values or Kubernetes manifests for syntax issues.
